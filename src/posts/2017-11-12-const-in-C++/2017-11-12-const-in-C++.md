# const in C++

It's mostly found when declaring a variable something like `const int a = 3;`
However, it is a sort of "promise" for human being since it will usually not make a difference in the compiled code.

Just as we can break a "promise" sometimes, there is also a workaround to modify `const` variable.

## const variable

It's self-explanatory. We know what it means when we see it.

```c++
const int a = 3;

// illegal
// a = 5;
```

## const with pointer

This is when the most confusing part because there are following variations

```c++
const int* a;
int* const a;
int const* a;
const int* const a;
```

what I would like to think is that `const` decorate something that is in its left. For example,

- `int const *` means `int` is constant because `int` is in the left.

If there is nothing in its left, `const` looks for its right side.

- `const int *` means the same as above. `int` is constant not `int*`


Then it's fairly easy.


```c++
// int is constant
// content cannot be changed
const int* a;

// ok (can be assigned to another pointer)
a = nullptr;
```



```c++
// `const` decorate `*`
// pointer cannot be re assigned
int* const a = new int;

// But, this is ok
*a = 33;

// not ok
// a = nullptr;
```


```c++
// `const` decorate `int`
// it's same as `const int* a`
int const* a = new int;
```
